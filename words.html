<p id="intro">
For a long time <br>
We have been judging how much <br> an individual earns based on his or her <br> ability, experience and education, etc. <br><br>
<b>But is this really reasonable?</b><br><br>
Is there a mechanism that allows everyone's outcome of work to be labelled with a price, <br>
<b>and the price to be obtained fairly, efficiently and automatically?</b><br>
<b>Let those who truly contribute be rewarded accordingly？</b><br><br>
After nearly <b>three years</b> of exploration and practice, we think <b>"EI voting"</b> can help us achieve this! <br><br>
So, to understand all this ...

<p id="coop_understand_0_top">
Suppose there is a community where every contributor in the community can claim "Fees" from the community with his
"outcome of Work", and "Fees" can be according to his own standard, as long as it does not deviate too much from the
community consensus, can be accepted.
</p>

<p id="coop_understand_0_btm">
Okay, next ...<br>
In front of you is three players, all of you have done the same thing, but the offer from <span class="greedy">"Greedy"</span> is 12 coins, and <span class="honest">"Honest Man"</span> is 8 coins, and next, it's your turn ...

<p id="coop_understand_0_honest_coin">8 Coins</p>
<p id="coop_understand_0_greedy_coin">12 Coins</p>

<p id="coop_understand_1_top">
Then comes the vote ... ; One person, one vote, everyone can vote according to their own standards for people who they think are more valuable and more efficient, except themselves.
</p>
<p id="coop_understand_1_greedy_vote">
First, the Greedy voted first...
</p>
<p id="coop_understand_1_honest_vote">
Then, the Honest Man also voted...<br>
</p>
<p id="coop_understand_1_oneself_vote">
Well, it's just you again, who are you going to vote for?
</p>
<p id="coop_understand_1_greedy_button">Greedy</p>
<p id="coop_understand_1_honest_button">Honest Man</p>

<p id="coop_understand_2_top_word">The result will be...</p>

<p id="coop_understand_2_bottom_word">
You see! Sometimes it is not necessary to quote higher to have a higher income, but instead those who start with a low price may appear to be overtaken. <br><br>
Oh oh, it should be noted that according to the rules when the EI value is less than 0.8, the offer is cut in half! And all the above votes are anonymous and can be confirmed on the blockchain!

<b><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Pairing Rules</span></b>
</p>

<p id="rule_understand_0_top_word">
If you think that's it, No! No! No! In reality, each contributor may produce multiple "Results" at different "price"; The system then needs to match these "Results" so that people can vote on them.
<br><br>Here are the "Results" and "price" submitted by the three players:
</p>

<p id="rule_understand_0_bottom_word">
So, how will it be paired?

<p id="rule_understand_0_dialogue">
${size_num} Results
</p>

<p id="rule_understand_0_button">
Start pairing
</p>

<p id="rule_understand_1_top_word">
Yes, that's right! To be fair, the more similar the "Price", the more likely two "Results" are to match; So, here's the pairing ...
</p>

<p id="rule_understand_1_bottom_word">
You, as one of the voters, have to cast multiple rounds of a "Two for one" vote. The final result will be determined by three voters.

<p id="convergence_title"><b><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">Convergence</span></b></p>

<p id="convergence_0_intro">
Okay, then, let's assume that the community has 30 people, with 10 each of the greedy <span class="greedy">"Greedy"</span>, the lowest price <span class="honest">"Honest Man"</span>, and the reasonable <span class="oneself">"Ordinary People"</span>. Let's see how the composition of contributors changes over time ...
</p>

<p id="convergence_0_1">
<b>1. Voting</b><br>
Once a month, the community holds a workload vote
</p>

<p id="convergence_0_2">
<b>2. Eliminate inefficiencies</b><br>
After each vote, eliminate the five types with the lowest input-output returns
</p>

<p id="convergence_0_3">
<b>3. Increase efficiency</b><br>
After each vote, add five types of people with the highest input-output return
</p>

<p id="convergence_0_button">
... Let us try it &rarr;
</p>

<p id="convergence_1_intro">
Now, let's start the "Vote - Eliminate - Add" 3-step dance and repeat it several times!<br><br>
Let's see what happens ...
</p>

<p id="start_button">START</p>

<p id="step_button">step</p>

<p id="reset_button">reset</p>

<p id="stop_button">STOP</p>

<p id="convergence_1_process">
We use the benefit-output ratio as a measure of elimination, always eliminating the 5 people with the lowest
benefit-output ratio and increasing the 5 people with the highest benefit-output ratio<br><br>
Obviously, the first to be eliminated is <span class="greedy">"Greedy"</span>... <br><br>
Then, <span class="greedy">"Greedy"</span> were all out ... <br><br>
Following closely behind, <span class="honest">"Honest Man"</span> also slowly increased the "fees" they applied for
due to the low returns, and turned themselves into <span class="oneself">"Ordinary People"</span> ... <br><br>
Finally, the results show ...
</p>

<p id="convergence_1_conclusion">
... <span class="oneself">"Ordinary People"</span> stayed. <br><br>
In the short term, <span class="greedy">"Greedy"</span> and <span class="honest">"Honest Man"</span>will stay in the group for a while, but eventually we will see that when they are punished, <span class="greedy">"Greedy"</span> will be restrained and <span class="honest">"Honest Man"</span>will realize the need to be more efficient.<br><br>
As a result, you will see the members of the team gradually reach a consensus, and eventually evolve into the same kind of person.

<p id="convergence_2_page">
Above, reveals the three things we need to master in order to get as many votes as possible.<br><br><br><br>
<span class="oneself" style="font-size: 1.8em;">1. Make "Price" as small as possible</span><br>
You need to know that voting is a "Two for one" process, and that a higher quality Results is better for the same price.<br><br><br>
<span class="honest" style="font-size: 1.8em;">2. Get "Results" as much as possible</span><br>
When you have a lot of results, you can declare more prices, and each price is a vote.<br><br><br>
<span class="greedy" style="font-size: 1.8em;">3. Be as "Efficient" as possible</span><br>
Results as the only reference for the community, of course, the more efficiently completed, the higher the return!<br><br><br>
</p>

<p id="conclusion">
We are all ordinary people, we all have a greedy side, we sometimes want to be lazy; but when their "results" and "price" will be made public, "human nature" will jump out and start to play, and then ... convergence works.<br><br>
Similarly, if someone is punished or earns less than expected, it will drive people towards the "three things", and the temptation of higher returns will drive people to be more efficient in order to produce more "results".<br><br>
Of course, real-world is affected by much more than this. There's fraud, difficulty in quantification, understanding bias, blah blah blah. However, we would like to tell you with our personal experience in the past three years: EI voting is much fairer and more reasonable than the traditional compensation system...
